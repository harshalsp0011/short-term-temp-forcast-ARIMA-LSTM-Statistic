Plan of Study:
LSTM Model Refinement:
Implement dropout layers in the LSTM model to prevent overfitting
Experiment with different LSTM architectures (e.g., stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM)
Conduct hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM model (e.g., number of units, learning rate)
Hybrid Model Development:
Develop a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model by combining predictions from both models
Explore different integration strategies for the hybrid model (e.g., weighted average, using ARIMA for trend and LSTM for residuals)
Comprehensive Evaluation Strategy:
Implement additional evaluation metrics beyond RMSE:
a) Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
b) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
c) Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)
Conduct performance comparisons across different forecast horizons (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month forecasts)
Implement time series cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
Multi-City Analysis:
Extend the analysis to multiple U.S. cities beyond Albuquerque
Compare model performances across different geographical locations and climate patterns
Advanced Visualization:
Create more comprehensive visualizations to illustrate model comparisons and forecast accuracies
Implement residual analysis plots (e.g., ACF, PACF plots)
Develop forecast uncertainty visualizations (e.g., fan charts)
Statistical Testing:
Implement the Diebold-Mariano test to formally compare forecast accuracies between models
Code Optimization and Documentation:
Refactor the code for improved efficiency and readability
Enhance code comments and documentation for better reproducibility
Timeline:
Weeks 1-2: LSTM refinement and hybrid model development
Week 3: Comprehensive evaluation and multi-city analysis
Week 4: Advanced visualization and statistical testing
Week 5: Code optimization, documentation, and final report preparation
This plan builds upon your existing work, focusing on enhancing the LSTM model, developing the hybrid approach, and conducting a more comprehensive evaluation across multiple cities. It also emphasizes the importance of advanced visualization and statistical testing to provide a thorough analysis of the models' performance.
